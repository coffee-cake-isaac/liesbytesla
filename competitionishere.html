    <p>Today, September 9, 2020, is a day that should be etched into Earth. This is the day that we finally have a

        So, a lot of you are probably either on one of two sides of the fence. We'll call this "American EV Brand
        Fanboys" and "Lucid Motors Lovers". Let's go ahead and get one thing out of the
        way here: <b>Any competition in the EV arena should be praised until we can get battery prices down to a level
            where the people buying Toyota Camrys and Honda Civics can get into one</b>
        and <b>competition breeds innovation and forces companies that could previously fuck you over to have to do
            *something* to not lose your business.</b>
    </p>
    <h5>Charging Infrastructure</h5>
    <p>So, let's go ahead and address the elephant in the room: the response from the "American EV Brand Fanboys" --
        <br /><br /><b>"Oh My GoD tHeY'rE USinG ELeCTRIfy amERIca"</b><br />Okay, yeah. I don't agree with what EA did
        with
        their
        I-95 line of chargers. I don't think anyone is defending it. BUT what this is doing is helping other
        companies by further investing in the brand of chargers that other auto manufacturers will use. Now, I'd
        like to take this time to also say that the rate of superchargers is not growing proportionately to the rate
        of Tesla vehicles on the road. And this is going to become a problem. You see, every year around
        Thanksgiving time, certain areas with a high concentration of Teslas will end up fighting for spots at high
        usage superchargers. There's been backups in the past. Don't believe me? <a
            href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/31274/more-teslas-on-the-road-meant-hours-long-supercharger-lines-over-thanksgiving"></b>
            Here's an article by The Drive detailing all the issues that users encountered while traveling last
            holiday.</a><br />So while you might not want to hear this, we need more options with the charging
        infrastructure if we ever want EVs to become mainstream enough that we can do away with ICEs, long wait times on
        road trips, and fair costs to keep the price of the EVs a selling point. And that means either the US needs to
        get on a standard for charging ports so we can all benefit, or we need to encourage other companies to continue
        to expand their infrastructure.
    </p>
    <h5>Costs</h5>
    <p><b>"IT COSTS $180,000 FOR THE HIGHEST TRIM MODEL AND $80,000 FOR THE LOWEST TRIM MODEL? OMG THAT'S SO MUCH
            MONEY</b>
        I think some of you need some reminders that when Tesla started selling their vehicles, they were astronomical
        in prices as well. For reference, I've pulled an MVPA from an <a
            href="https://onlyusedtesla.com/listing/model-s-2015-gray-metallic-227a4/">OnlyUsedTesla listing</a> for a
        2015 P85DL. The price was $133,470 USD. This was 3 years AFTER Tesla started selling their vehicles. So, if
        Lucid is able to come out swinging at a $95,000 entry point for a comparable sedan that took Tesla EIGHT YEARS
        to reach, I feel like they deserve credit where the credit is due.</p>
    <h5>Charging</h5>
    <p>So, continuing on with the news, let's talk about the charging. As more and more EVs hit the market and more
        consumers start adopting the "new" way to road trip, charge speeds will be critical going forward. Let's go
        ahead and establish that nothing will be faster than filling up your car with that 87 Dino Juice. BUT, the Lucid
        Air will be one of, if not the FASTEST charging EV on the market. This beats out the Porsche Taycan and all
        current Teslas. They are advertising 300 miles added to the pack in 20 minutes. This is <b>MASSIVE.</b> They are
        advertising the entire range and more of the Model 3 Performance, and most of the range for a Long Range Dual
        Motor Model 3. In TWENTY MINUTES. And this is all capable because of their in-house black box they've dubbed the
        "Wunderbox". This ensures that you are always charging at peak voltage, regardless of where you are in your
        charge profile. <b>Also (as if this wasn't already fucking nuts)</b>, the vehicle is capable of Vehicle-to-Grid
        AND Vehicle-to-Vehicle charging. We don't have enough here to expand on this, but it basically means that you
        can save stranded EV drivers low on charge OR power your small home appliances during an outage.</p>
    <h5>Driver Assistance Features</h5>
    <p>I don't know if Lucid was just trying to one up Tesla or if they're trying to make this thing sentient, but they
        put an absolutely absurd amount of hardware on this thing. If you go to <a
            href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-dreamdrive-most-comprehensive-adas-suite">Lucid Motor's
            webpage detailing their "DreamDrive" (as they call it)</a>, you'll see that it has 32 DIFFERENT SENSORS.
        These
        include cameras, ultrasonic sensors, lidar, radar, and driver montioring cameras. Until we can see how they
        integrate all of this together to provide a seamless driver assistance package, it's to be determined how it
        will be in comparison to Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self Drive software.</a> However, in the mean time, I want
        to remind everyone what Elon said about LiDAR during his Autonomy Day presentation in this video from AutoPilot
        Review's YouTube Channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM23sjhtk4Q">"Anyone relying on LiDAR is
            doomed"</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>Final Verdict</h5>
    <p>I'm not saying that this car is the "Tesla Killer". But, it would be disingenuous for me to also say that this
        car is going to be a MONSTER when (read: if) it reaches the masses. You see, as Tesla has proven time and time
        again, building cars is hard. And building cars that people want to spend $80,000-$160,000 is probably even
        harder. Due to the price range reaching the floor of prices for an Aston Martin Vantage, they will need to
        absolutely nail the fit and finish. This is going to be the only thing that can separate Lucid from other
        manufacturers. However, if they succeed, and they take the route that Tesla did where they build the expensive
        car first, and the cheaper cars later, we could see an entire Lucid lineup that will rival Tesla and finally
        bring some much needed competition to the industry. </p>
    <p>Let us know what you think below. Are we blowing smoke out our asses or do you think Lucid has a real shot at
        taking down Musk and his bullshit? </p>
