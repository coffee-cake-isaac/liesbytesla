                    <h2>How Lies by Tesla Started</h2>
                    <p>When Tesla's software version 2020.36 started rolling out, it had a huge feature that everyone had been wanting for quite some time. This feature was the speed limit reading
                        update. There was immediate question surrounding whether HW2.5 vehicles were going to get the update or not. You see, Tesla is a big fan of saying "fuck you" to the entire
                        industry and decided to do away with model years. The years of having a "2020 Nissan Sentra" or "2015 Ford F-150" was "stupid" or something. They never really gave a
                        definitive reason. Instead, they constantly change what things are and are not included in their cars. This meant that in the Spring of 2020, Tesla decided that they were
                        going to release a new computer for their vehicles, dubbed "Hardware 3.0" or HW3. This went in every new car from roughly halfway through April 2019 and is currently being
                        supplied in all cars being made on the line today.</p>
                    <p>"Why's that matter?" Well, you see... I bought my car just about two weeks before they started doing this. And as a result, when they pushed software update 2020.36 to the
                        Tesla fleet, only those folks with HW3.0 would get any actual features in this release. This isn't the first time that it has happened. It happened when they released the
                        "full-self-driving preview" in December of 2019. Contrary to the name, however, you do not need Full Self Driving to actually use the preview... just hardware 3.</p>
                    <p>Out of a fit of rage, I had bought the domain <a href="https://liesbytesla.com">https://liesbytesla.com</a> as a tongue-in-cheek joke... but the saying "behind every joke
                        is some true shit". I really was tired of the lies that Tesla and Elon Musk spout on a daily basis without actually backing it up or having to answer to the fact that it's
                        far from true. They are a publicly traded company with a product that is extremely expensive for most people. They should be held to the same standards as other auto
                        manufacturers. In fact, they should be held to the same standards as other tech companies as well since Tesla has a vertical integration on just about everything, including
                        their software suite.</p>
                    <p>So now, I sit on my ass and write in a very "tongue-in-cheek" tone, but there's some factual evidence to back up the posts that are on this website. We try to highlight the
                        bullshit, expose the truth, and provide users with a good laugh all while trying to spark a thought in their head to do their own research. We attempt to have "journalistic
                        integrity" but we understand that we're filtering things through our view point. We highly encourage viewers, readers and aliens to do their own research and to draw their
                        own conclusions. <b>And this extends far beyond this website. This should be done in every facet of life. Be educated. Be smart. Be informed.</b></p>
