    <h3>Autopilot, Full Self Drive, and a Fair Comparison</h3>
    <h5>So, this is an opinion article. It's the very first one we've done. We'll gauge how this does and determine if
        we'll do more in the future. There are facts in this article, so please feel free to fact check. Just want to
        make you aware that this may have a slightly different tone than rest of the articles. Enjoy.</h5>
    <p>Tesla's main selling point, even when compared to ICE (internal combustion engine) cars, is unequivocally the
        autopilot software. This, according to most Tesla owners, is one of the things that separates Tesla from any
        other car on the road. Autopilot's feature set is different from the Full Self Driving feature set. Allow me to
        break those down:
    <ul>
        <lh>Basic Autopilot:</lh>
        <li>Traffic Aware Cruise Control</li>
        <li>Autosteer (Keeps you within your lane and drives with the curvature of the road you're on.</li>
    </ul>
    Yep... that's pretty much it for basic autopilot. This price is included in the price of the car (cars went up
    $2000 to include this as a feature. <b>Note: This is a $1000 discount from the price it would have been to
        purchase autopilot as car DLC</b>)
    <br /><br />
    <ul id="fullSelfDrivingList">
        <lh>Full Self Driving (pulled from <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot">Tesla's website):</a></lh>
        <li>Basic Summon</li>
        <li>Smart Summon</li>
        <li>Navigate on Autopilot</li>
        <li>Autopark</li>
        <li>Traffic and Stop Sign Control (Beta)</li>
        <li>Auto lane change</li>
        <ul>
            <lh>Coming in a future update:</lh>
            <li>Auto Steer on City Streets</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    So, I have the Traffic and Stop Sign Control marked as beta, as that's what's listed on the support page on the
    Tesla website for autopilot. However, it is worth noting that Tesla considers its entire autopilot suite to be in
    beta. <b>Note: This is an $8,000 option to add onto your car. Can be done at any time. The price for Full Self
        Driving will continue to go up as Tesla releases software updates containing features of Full Self Driving that
        it deems "complete". </b><br /><br />
    <b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190410153216/https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot"
            id="waybackMachine">Using the wayback
            machine, this wording is very different than what Tesla promised back in 2019 of April. And we'll get to
            this in a second.</a></b>
    </p>
    <p>So, I recently just went on a road trip from NC to PA. This is why there wasn't a post yesterday. It was a 9hr
        and 26m drive. Not a bad drive at all. Saw some beautiful parts of Virginia. Had some laughs with my wife. Got
        some bomb ass food at this sus diner we passed on the way up and overall had a good trip. For this trip, we
        decided it was better to take my wife's ICE car (2019 Volkswagen Tiguan). It has a spacious boot and a very
        comfortable ride. It's a lot easier for my pregnant wife to get in and out of compared to the low ride height of
        my
        Tesla Model 3. It's equipped with Traffic Aware Cruise Control and no steering/lane centering/lane keep assist.
        And I gotta say, the VW's TACC is far superior to Tesla's, at least in it's current state. You see, Tesla
        continues to improve on their software after it comes out through over-the-air updates. Something a bit unique
        to Tesla with other car manufacturers following behind it. Porsche and Ford have promised OTA updates. Porsche
        said their first update cannot be performed OTA and we've yet to see what Ford can do.
    </p>
    <p>For the entire trip up, I had TACC on almost all the time. I'd say I disengaged it about the same time I'd
        disengage Tesla's autopilot. If we were in a city/town and I didn't know the roads, or if I was at a stop light
        and didn't want any jerky stop/go traffic. Just for a comparison, the Tiguan does not have any cameras what so
        ever to use TACC. It's all done via radar. So, imagine my surprise when (even the few times I've tried it on
        city streets or when someone cut me off) tight traffic didn't cause the car to slam on it's brakes. Not once, on
        the entire 400ish mile trip, did my wife say "what the fuck?" and I had to explain "Oh it was autopilot". This
        is important because it speaks volumes into how unpredictable Tesla's autopilot is. I'll be fair here and
        concede that when Tesla's autopilot is working and it's on a software version where everything seems to be
        calculated properly, it's impressive and very smooth. But this changes with every software release.</p>
    <p>I think it's safe to say that while I did miss the autosteer part of the autopilot suite, I didn't miss the
        jerkiness of the TACC. It's crazy to me that on every software release, people have to say "How's autopilot this
        time?". But what's even crazier to me, is that Tesla has this huge suite of hardware and a very powerful set of
        software to interpret this hardware suite's input and yet... it still can't perform as well as a single radar on
        a VW Tiguan.</p>
    <p><b>So, let's talk about Full Self Drive for a moment.
        </b> Tesla claims this will be the future of driving. In fact, on their <a
            href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot">current autopilot page</a>, Tesla makes bold claims such as
    <blockquote>"When you
        arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode,
        automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you."
    </blockquote>
    and <br />
    <br />
    <blockquote>"All you will
        need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you donâ€™t say anything, your car will look at your
        calendar and take you there as the assumed destination. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigating
        urban streets, complex intersections and freeways."</blockquote>
    However, this sounds <b>very</b> different than what Tesla is claiming on their support page. If you <a
        href="#fullSelfDrivingList">look back to the list of features</a>, it says "autosteer on city streets". If we
    use the term autosteer in the current sense of autosteer for basic autopilot, that means that it's only going to
    keep you in your lane and follow the curves on the road. This is probably not the case, but it paints a picture of
    Tesla's lack of consistency and their failure to make easy-to-understand terminoloyy for consumers. So, Tesla,
    what'll it be? Automatic Navigation on City Streets as you mentioned in your <a href="#waybackMachine">FSD wording
        in April of 2019, or is it just autosteer on city streets?</a> And if it's the former, what
    constituted the change in the terminology at all? Why do we as consumers have to make a guess as to what you mean,
    and what your car is actually capable of doing?
    </p>
    <p>My opinion: Tesla has allegedly <a
            href="https://electrek.co/2020/08/18/tesla-hw-4-0-self-driving-chip-tsmc-for-mass-production-q4-2021-report/">started
            working on HW4.</a> The current set of features that we're expected to see with HW3 will be the last set of
        features we see for FSD in it's current iteration. What do I mean by that? Musk has repeatedly said FSD is worth
        stupid amounts of money and even put a price on it as you can see here:
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving
            capability with regulatory approval. It that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of
            $100,000.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a
            href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1262530589506273280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2020</a>
    </blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
    If something is worth $100,000, why would you sell it for anything less? I'm <b>speculating</b> that Tesla will sell
    ANOTHER tier of Full Self Driving and will charge stupid amounts for it. I'm guessing this will be the
    "coast-to-coast fully autonomous drive" that he's reportedly been touting. Of course, this is all <b>speculation</b>
    (<B>SPECULATION</B>), but if HW3 is capable of performing all the features they've already laid out, then what's the
    need for HW4? And why not charge $100,000 when FSD is "feature complete"? Unless, this isn't the last of the FSD
    tiers.
    </p>
    <p>I don't know... don't be a drone. Do some reading on the promises of Musk, Tesla and Full Self Driving. Find his
        claims, find the due dates he's put out there and draw a conclusion for yourself. And hold Tesla and Musk to
        their claims now.
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, that's it. My posts may be sporadic until I'm back home.
        <br /><br />
        See ya, fuckers
