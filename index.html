					<h1>Lies by Tesla<br /></h1>
					<p>A detailed account of all the lies that Elon Musk or Tesla have claimed over the years,
						highlighting their lack of customer service, their half-assed attempts to shift accountablity to
						others and pretending like they can do no wrong because they're a "green" company.</p>
					<p>This website is constantly being updated and you may see placeholder items in place. Yes, I know
						it's there. They'll get phased out as the website presence is built up.</p>
					<p>"Oh my god. You used a theme?! Are you even a developer?!?!!!?111?!" - You, probably. </p>
					<p>But to answer that question, yes. But I have a full time job and a family. I don't have time to
						fuck with this shit 24/7. Get over it.</p>
					<p>I do want to point something out: I like my car. I like the ideas of EVs. I like the idea of cars
						getting better over time. But Tesla has been spewing bullshit for far too long and it's time
						someone makes it blatantly obvious.</p>

						don't. I don't care either way.</p>

				<p>So, fuck all that fancy shit. We're just going to have a never ending scrolling website of
					all the times that Tesla has lied.
					We'll make sure to highlight when Tesla lied and how to differentiate it from the time of
					the post.
					I think it's fair to you all to know that we aren't going to only pull from their latest
					bullshit, but from the start of their company if we find it relevant. So, let's get on with
					the first post.

									Here, we prove that Tesla has been lying since 2016 in regards to the hardware
									necessary for FSD and how they're now withholding features to sell vaporware.</p>
