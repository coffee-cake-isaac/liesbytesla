					<h1>Lies by Tesla<br /></h1>
					<p>A detailed account of all the lies that Elon Musk or Tesla have claimed over the years,
						highlighting their lack of customer service, their half-assed attempts to shift accountablity to
						others and pretending like they can do no wrong because they're a "green" company.</p>
					<p>This website is constantly being updated and you may see placeholder items in place. Yes, I know
						it's there. They'll get phased out as the website presence is built up.</p>
					<p>"Oh my god. You used a theme?! Are you even a developer?!?!!!?111?!" - You, probably. </p>
					<p>But to answer that question, yes. But I have a full time job and a family. I don't have time to
						fuck with this shit 24/7. Get over it.</p>
					<p>I do want to point something out: I like my car. I like the ideas of EVs. I like the idea of cars
						getting better over time. But Tesla has been spewing bullshit for far too long and it's time
						someone makes it blatantly obvious.</p>

					<p>So, fuck all that fancy shit. We're just going to have a never ending scrolling website of
						all the times that Tesla has lied.
						We'll make sure to highlight when Tesla lied and how to differentiate it from the time of
						the post.
						I think it's fair to you all to know that we aren't going to only pull from their latest
						bullshit, but from the start of their company if we find it relevant. So, let's get on with
						the first post.
					</p>
					<h2>Software Version 2020.36 (Pub 9/1/2020)</h2>
					<p>I bought my Tesla Model 3 on March 31, 2019. I had just hit the mark for the $3,750 tax
						credit. I
						was
						ecstatic to finally own what I thought was going to be my dream car. The car has had a
						handful
						of
						service visits and mobile tech visits, but that's not what this shit's about. We're only
						highlighting the bullshit lies that Tesla spreads. In April of 2019, <b>TWO FUCKING
							WEEKS</b>
						after
						I bought my car, Tesla held Autonomy day and put the final nail in the coffin of
						obsolescence
						for my
						vehicle.</p>
					<p>Let me explain: <br />
						Today, a new software update is being pushed to most of the Tesla fleet. "OH MY GOD THAT IS
						SO COOL TESLAS ARE THE ONLY CARS THAT DO THAT IT'S LIKE OWNING A NEW CAR ALL THE TIME".
						Okay, yeah. That's true. But that's only true if you are running the absolute latest
						hardware. Let's break down the hardware real quick for any newcomers, people unaware of how
						Tesla handles model years (hint: they don't) and how their production line is a constant
						<del>work-in-progress with a list of defects that are impossible to catch because how do you
							hit a moving target when you're being yelled at for not hitting the moving target?</del>
						change in their entire manufacturing process.</p>
					<p>
					<h4>Hardware</h4>
					<p><b>2014 - Oct 2016: HW1 (Hardware 1)</b>: This was hardware designed and developed by
						MobilEye
						called
						the
						MobilEye EyeQ3. This was released in 2014 and was labeled AP (Autopilot) HW1. This was came
						equipped
						with a forward radar, a forward camera, and 12 surrounding sonars.<br />
						<b>Oct 2016 - August 2017: HW2 (Hardware 2)</b>: This was designed and developed by NVIDIA
						called
						NVIDIA
						DRIVE PX 2 AI computing platform. This came equipped with a forward radar, a front / side
						camera
						color filter array, 3 forward cameras (Natrrow, Main and Wide), two forward looking side
						cameras, 2
						rearward looking side cameras, and 12 surrounding sonars.<br />
						<b>August 2017 - April 2019: HW2.5 (Hardware 2.5)</b>: This was designed and developed by
						NVIDIA
						called
						NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 with secondary node enabled. This came with equipped with a forward radar,
						a
						front
						/ side camera color filter array, 3 forward cameras (Natrrow, Main and Wide), two forward
						looking
						side cameras, 2 rearward looking side cameras, and 12 surrounding sonars. <br />
						<b>April 2019 - Current: HW3 (Hardware 3)</b>: This was designed and developed by Tesla
						containing
						two
						identical chips (also designed/developed by Tesla) and the rest of the hardware suite in
						HW2.5
					</p>
					</p>
					<h3>Autonomy Day</h3>
					<p>Around the start of Q2FY19 for Tesla, they had autonomy day. This was a huge presentation on
						Youtube
						where some of the top minds in machine learning gave presentations on how difficult it is to
						safely
						achieve full self driving vehicles and answered questions from the press and invenstors. Of
						course,
						this wouldn't be possible without some interruptions from Elon on how he thinks something is
						on
						orders of magnitude better than something else after starting the entire presentation late.
					</p>
					<p>
						On autonomy day, Pete Bannon explained that they had been working on a new hardware chip for
						full
						self driving for the last three years. The chip is capable of computing power that far
						exceeds
						all
						HW2.5 chips in any cars manufacturered between August 2017 and April 2019. This is an
						indisputable
						fact. Pete, his colleagues, and Tesla had created a chip that was designed perfectly for
						their
						needs
						to accomplish FSD (Full Self Driving). And ever since this day, it became evident that the
						car I
						had
						purchased two weeks ago was now obsolete.
					</p>
					<p>"You mean that your car can't drive itself without that hardware? How do you get it?" Well,
						if
						you
						bought FSD (Full Self Drive), you have a free upgrade path to HW3 if you're HW2 or
						later.<br />"Oh,
						so you didn't even buy FSD? Why're you complaining then?" I'm complaining for a few reasons
						but
						the
						main reason, to put it lightly, is that Tesla's a bunch of fucking liars. You see, on Oct
						29,
						2016
						(<b>ALMOST 4 FULL YEARS AGO</b>), Tesla put out a <a
							href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware"
							target="_blank">blog
							post.</a><br />
						This blog post is pretty clear. They said, and I quote:
					<blockquote>
						"We are excited to announce that, as
						of
						today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory – including Model 3 – will have the
						hardware
						needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of
						a
						human
						driver. Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250
						meters
						of
						range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of
						both
						hard
						and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar
						with
						enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength,
						capable
						of
						seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead."<br />
						"To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the
						computing
						power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar
						and
						radar
						processing software. Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone
						cannot
						access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the
						human
						senses."<br /></blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>They have stated since 2016 that all vehicles produced since the blog post have the required
						hardware for FSD. But then they changed it... not once, but <b>twice</b>. From HW2 to HW2.5;
						and
						from HW2.5 to HW3. Now, everyone should be mad that they were lied to for almost four years.
						But
						Tesla is now putting out updates that favor HW3. And I can only speculate because Tesla is
						airtight
						on why, but I have to assume it's to cause FOMO for us basic AP drivers. They want us to
						drop
						another $8,000 (Yes... that's correct... <b>EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS</b>) to get what is
						essentially
						vaporware. We'll explain this in another post, but let's just say you get a couple party
						tricks,
						a
						userful feature, and curb rash on your wheels.</p>
					<p>You see, HW2.5 is being intentionally gimped. What do
						I mean by this? A well known Tesla owner has access to the root of his car (jailbreak?
						rooted?
						whatever you want to call it) and has said <a href="https://imgur.com/a/plwpCIR"
							target="_blank">this about the
							subject</a>. And he hits on something that I really need to highlight here when replying
						to
						another user.<br />
						<b>THE UPDATES ARE NOT FREE IF YOU PREPAID FOR THEM BEFOREHAND, ARE THEY?</b> We paid stupid
						amounts
						of money for this car... some far more than others (looking at you Model X owners). We paid
						stupid
						amounts of money under the assumption that our cars were "future-proof" (idk if we can even
						use
						this
						term because it's like saying things are waterproof). But, as of 2020.36 (which is being pushed
						out as I type this), <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1uOsl6o" target="_blank">this is what it looks
							like for me (I own a 2019 SR+ Model 3)</a>. So, I own
						the cheapest Tesla you can order on the website (techaniclities are fun, huh Tesla?). BUT...
						this is the same release notes for a 2019 Model X owner with EAP (Enhanced Autopilot) because he
						doesn't have HW3, either... imagine spending $100,000 on a car with the assumption that you'd
						get OTA updates as well as other things you'd expect when dropping $100,000 on a car.
					</p>
					<p>So, let's circle back here and just highlight the point of this website... <b>TESLA LIES</b>.
						They've lied about their hardware needed for FSD. They've lied about your cars getting OTA
						updates, and they've lied about other things as well. We're going to be highlighting Tesla's
						lies at least once a week. So, let me attempt to plug this shit real hard: <b>FAVORITE THIS
							FUCKING PAGE AND CHECK BACK OFTEN</b></p>
