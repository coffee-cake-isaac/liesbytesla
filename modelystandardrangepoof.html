    <h3>Want to see a magic trick?</h3>
    <p>Let's take a trip through time here and travel back to March 2019. This month seems to hold a lot of events
        either in Tesla's history or mine. I bought my "dream" car in March of 2019. I started looking for a new job.
        And Tesla... good ol' Tesla; Well, they announced their Model Y. Yes, the all-mighty Model Y -- the SUV to kill
        all SUVs. Musk had his usual presentation and the awkwardness that engulfs them. But, it was a pretty normal
        presentation (all things considered).</p>
    <p>The Model Y was well received, as predicted. For some reason, Americans have this fascination with driving SUVs
        and
        not sedans. In fact, Americans managed to kill Ford's entire sedan line (except for two cars) simply by voting
        with their wallet. Imagine, if we could collectively do that against Tesla... anyways. The Model Y had four
        variants according to Elon Musk in March 2019. The Performance, Dual Motor AWD, Long Range, and Standard Range.
    </p>
    <p>"OH MAN. WHY'S THIS IMPORTANT? WE KNOW THIS ALREADY"
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)</p>&mdash; Elon Musk
        (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1282496094908243968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13,

    </blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> This is why this is important.
    </p> Elon
    Musk stated in July of 2020, that the standard range variant would have been "unacceptably low". Let's unpack this a
    little bit.
    <ol>
        <img src="images/modelylineup.png" width="600" height="300">
        <li>
            <p>If we look at the above image, taken from the Tesla Model Y reveal video <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/Tb_Wn6K0uVs?t=2010">here, </a>Tesla has the standard range listed as
                $39,000...
                But one of the important things here is that the image says <b>230 miles</b>. That means, Tesla was
                entirely
                aware of this in <b>March 2019</b>. In July of 2020, he stated that the range of the standard range
                Model Y
                is <b>"unacceptable"</b>. If being less than 250 miles makes it "unacceptably low", then why even put it
                on
                the list of models to begin with? What a shitty thing to do... mislead consumers.</p>
            <p><b>BUT WAIT -- THERES MORE</b>
                Does anyone happen to know the range of the Standard Range Plus Model 3 when it launched and until Oct.
                2019 according to <a
                    href="https://electrek.co/2019/10/17/tesla-increases-range-base-model-3-price-up/">this article from
                    Electrek.</a> THAT'S RIGHT! Less than 250 miles! It was at 240 miles. But then, the range suddenly
                went up 10 miles without any explanation from anyone? Hardware?
                Software? Was it the introduction of full-one-pedal driving? Who the fuck knows because Tesla never said
                why.</p>
            <p><b>BUT WAIT -- THERES EVEN MORE</b> Does anyone happen to know the range of the off-menu Model 3 Standard
                Range? RIGHT AGAIN. LESS THAN 250 MILES. That variant will net you about 220 miles. So, if "250 miles is
                unacceptable", why do they currently sell the Standard Range Model 3, and why did they sell the Standard
                Range Plus variant until Oct 2019?<br />Speculation: There's not enough meat on the bones for Tesla to
                warrant selling the Standard Range Model Y. Which, I mean, Tesla's a business. They're not a charity. If
                the profit margin is too thin, just be transparent. Don't pretend like you're doing it because it
                "doesn't meet your standards". We're adults. We can handle some bad news every once and a while.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Musk follows up his tweet with the following tweet:</p>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
                <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor &amp; will offer a LR single
                    motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent</p>
                &mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1282499399562588160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a>
            </blockquote>
            <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            <p>"WELL THIS IS GOOD NEWS RIGHT?! THEYRE COMPROMISING." Let's dig deeper here for a second. If we look back
                at the picture detailing the line up, there are 4 variants. Performance, Long Range Dual Motor, Long
                Range, and Standard Range. So, if we pretend we're Nancy Drew and use some deductive reasoning, get rid
                of the Standard Range variant, there's three left. Performanance is already shipping and Long Range Dual
                Motor is already shipping... so that leaves just one. And if we've already got a dual motor, then *GASP*
                IT'S A SINGLE MOTOR LONG RANGE.
            </p>
            <p>This really just confirms that Tesla wasn't lying about that (BECAUSE WE HAVE JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY),
                but that rather Tesla was trying to appear like they're doing right by
                everyone by having a Long Range RWD variant. The thing up in the air is how much that Long Range RWD is
                going to cost. Musk neither confirmed nor denied that they would cost roughly $45,000. See below:</p>

    <p>So, now that we have the history behind us (puns are fun), can we talk about this? Seriously? How the fuck is it
        possible for Tesla to put up some bullshit, that definitely had some kind of impact on consumer's spending, the
        stock price, and the public reception of Tesla? Imagine if Apple said "We're gonna sell a $600 Macbook Pro with
        only cloud storage", opened up reservations (or accepted payment of any kind), and then turned around and said
        "HAHA JK. Wasn't enough storage for our users."<br />
        They would never do that shit. You know why? Because they don't make promises on things they can't deliver on.
        I'm not going to say Apple doesn't lie about things, because every business does (obviously...) but I'll be
        damned if Apple got caught doing the same shit Tesla does. Tim Cook would be shunned to Antarctica. Stop letting
        Tesla get away with things. They absolutely deserve to be held accountable for shit like this.
    </p>
    <p>Now, for those of you that made it this far, that's dope. Thanks for reading. You'll see some changes
        over the next coming weeks that will focus on interacting with the posts. Likes, Smiles, Dislikes, Reactions
        with Emojis? I don't know yet. (See how easy that is?) I'll play around with some options and we'll see what
        comes out of it.</p>
    <p>See ya, fuckers.</p>
