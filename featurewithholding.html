    <h3>It started with just wanting to vent...</h3>
    <p>After writing my first article yesterday, I had felt a lot better. You know... the whole venting thing normally
        makes people feel better. Then I started looking at the internet, talking to people in discord, browsing
        reddit... normal things. And in the process of all of this, I stumbled upon something. Now, before I get into
        this I think I have to say something that I never thought I'd say... Elon Musk and Donald Trump are the most
        prolific liars I've ever seen in my life. In fact, Democratic Presdiential Candidate Joe Biden is calling for
        live fact checking in their debates because Donald Trump is known to say some outlandish shit. I'd like to make
        a motion to have someone fact check Elon Musk and Tesla at all future shareholder meetings and "XXXX" investory
        days, where XXXX is the next "revolution in driving tech".</p>
    <h3>But it's just so easy...</h3>
    <p>So, let's get into the meat of what this article is going to be discussing. It loops directly into what I posted
        yesterday. So, while this might sound like I'm repeating myself, it's probably because I am. Today, while
        checking on some things related to HW3, I stumbled across Tesla's <a
            href="https://www.tesla.com/support/full-self-driving-computer">support page</a> for their Full Self Driving
        computer. This was pretty standard stuff all around. "Yaddie yaddie yaddie, you can get it if you spend $8,000
        on car DLC". I kept reading, and I noticed one very particular thing. Under the FAQ section of the page, there's
        a question. It states: <br /><b>"Will my car performance or features change after the FSD Computer is
            installed?"</b>
        <br /><br />With the answer being <br /><br />
        <i>With the exception of the latest Driving Visualization, the FSD Computer installation will not affect the
            performance of your car and is not required to use any driver assistance features we offer. Learn more about
            currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving capabilities.</i><br /><br />
        Hold up, hold up, hold up... let me emphaize this for your dense motherfuckers who are constantly defending
        Tesla's bullshit:
        "With the exception of the latest Driving Visualization, <b>the FSD Computer installation will not affect the
            performance of your car and is not required to use any driver assistance features we offer</b>. Learn more
        about
        currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving capabilities."</p>
    <p>Let's just take a look back at the Release notes for 2020.36 using <a
            href="https://teslascope.com/teslapedia/software/2020.36">Teslascope</a>. I'll only be looking at United
        States as there's just too many configurations and localization changes to go through.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Driving Visualization Improvements</li>
        <p>Okay... this is pretty black and white. They said "With the exception of the latest driving
            visualizations..." Moving on.</p>
        <li>Green Traffic Light Chime</li>
        <p>This one could go either way here, but I'm going to say it's a driver assistance feature. The text states:
        <blockquote>
            A chime will play when the traffic light you are waiting for turns green. If you are waiting behind another
            car, the chime will play once the car advances unless Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer is active.
            When Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is activated, a chime will play when you can confirm to proceed
            through a green traffic light. To enable, tap Controls > Autopilot > Green Traffic Light Chime.
            <br />
            Note: This chime is only designed as a notification. It is the driverâ€™s responsibility to observe their
            environment and make decisions accordingly.
        </blockquote>
        <p>So, this provides no autonomy to the vehicle and is simply plays a noise when the light turns green and
            you're
            able to potentially proceed on your route. And because of that, this is an <i>ASSISTANCE</i> feature. But
            guess
            what... this requires (at the very least...) HW3. There is still rumors floating around that non-FSD owners
            will
            not get this feature. This feature that literally provides nothing but a chime when the light changes
            colors. A
            fucking three year old could do this and they're not even as aware and able to process as much information
            as
            Tesla's computers. HW2.5 or not. And that's an objective statement.</p>
        <li>Speed Assist Improvements</li>
        <blockquote>Speed Assist now leverages your car's cameras to detect speed limit signs to improve the accuracy of
            speed limit data on local roads.
            <br /><br />
            Speed Assist now leverages your car's cameras to detect speed limit signs to improve the accuracy of speed
            limit data on local roads. Detected speed limit signs will be displayed in the driving visualization and
            used to set the associated Speed Limit Warning.
            <br /><br />
            As usual, to adjust Speed Assist settings, tap Controls > Autopilot > Speed Limit.</blockquote>
        <p><b>THIS ONES IN THE FUCKING NAME AND DESCRIPTION</b>. Speed <b>ASSIST</b>. It's going to use my cameras to
            set the speed limit reading for AP/FSD. BUT WAIT. NOT IT'S NOT. NOT UNLESS YOU SPENT $8,000. MAN I SURE AM
            HAPPY THAT THE COMPANY I GAVE $40,000 LIED TO MY FACE AND IS INTENTIONALLY WITHHOLDING FEATURES. Refer to my
            last post: software updates aren't really free if you've already paid for them upfront, are they?</p>
        <li>Suspension Instrument Panel Display</li>
        <p>This is for Model S and Model X and doesn't really pertain to being any lies or whatever. Moving on.</p>
        <li>Cruise Set Speed Improvements</li>
        <p>All Model 3s and Model Ys will be getting this. Moving on.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>Man... I don't think it gets any fucking clearer than that, does it? "You don't have to pay" and then release an
        update that says "you need to pay". Honest to god, fuck this company. I've never seen another company lie so
        much and get away with it. I'm not a lawyer, but someone tell me how the fuck this isn't false advertising. This
        seems incredibly obvious. They're intentionally withholding features from owners/vechiles to sell some fucking
        gimmicks and auto lane changes. That's not a rhetorical statement. Literally, someone tell me how this isn't
        false advertisement. Email me. Do something. I hope someone realizes that this is a pattern of intentional
        disrespect to their buyers. My friend owns a five-year-old Mercedes and when he gets his oil changed, they use
        white gloves. They cover ever single seat and floor mat. It's like going to the fucking Grammy's. Meanwhile,
        Tesla can just say and do whatever they want because we as consumers are not pitching a big enough fit. We have
        the power, but only if we vote with our wallets. This isn't going to change any fanboiz opinions. Obviously...
        because you guys are fucking ruthless and defend everything that Tesla does. But fuck me, man, I hope this
        convinces someone to stay away from this company. Plenty of other EVs coming to the market soon enough.</p>
    <p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk. We'll be back soon with some other juicy lies that Tesla has come out with.
        They don't even try hiding them...</p>
